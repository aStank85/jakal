# Jakal v0.5.0 - Web Scraper Release Notes

## What Shipped

v0.5.0 delivers automated data collection from R6 Tracker using Playwright.
This release adds sync-first workflows while preserving manual paste as fallback.

Included in v0.5.0:

- Auto-scrape of season stats (parser-compatible output)
- Auto-scrape of map stats
- Auto-scrape of operator stats
- Auto-scrape of match history
- Match-detail parsing support for player leaderboard extraction
- New CLI flows:
  - Sync player
  - Sync all players
  - Manual add fallback
- Scraper-aware error handling:
  - `ScraperBlockedError`
  - `PlayerNotFoundError`

## New Data Sources Available

The following scraped datasets are now stored:

- `map_stats`
- `operator_stats`
- `match_history`
- `match_players`

These are stored alongside existing:

- `stats_snapshots`
- `computed_metrics`

## Installation Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install playwright beautifulsoup4
playwright install chromium
```

## Known Limitations

- Live scraping can be blocked by Cloudflare depending on request profile/timing.
- DOM structure changes on R6 Tracker can break selectors and require parser updates.
- Match history row count may vary by profile/session visibility despite 40-row target loading.
- Browser automation requires local environment permissions to launch Chromium.

## Next Version Preview (v0.5.1)

Planned focus for v0.5.1:

- Short-term plateau detection improvements
- Session-level stagnation flags
- Early trend diagnostics based on fresh auto-synced history
